## Hello World, I'm Roo.

I’m a Software Engineer at MongoDB, previously at Pulumi and Couchbase. Before that I studied Computer Science at Lancaster University. I’m currently based in the north of England.

I have experience with Go and Typescript, as well as a solid understanding of C, Python, Java, Bash and HTML/CSS - plus experience using various technologies including Kubernetes, Git, Jenkins, various SQL and NoSQL databases, and Docker. I have an interest in networking, distributed computing, and backend development.

My GitHub is primarily some personal projects and forks of work repositories, as well as some coursework from my time at University.
