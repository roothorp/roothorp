## Hello World, I'm Roo.

Iâ€™m a recent computer science graduate from Lancaster University, having graduated with a first-class honours degree. I'm currently based in the north of England.

I have lots of experience with Go, Python, and Java, as well as a solid understanding of C and HTML/CSS/JS, plus experience using various technologies including MySQL, Git, Nginx, and Docker. I have an interest in networking, distributed computing, and backend development.

My github is primarily a selection of coursework from my time at University, as well as some personal projects. 

I am currently working as a Software Engineer in Test for Cloud at Couchbase!
