## Hello World, I'm Roo.

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer in Test at Couchbase, having graduated from Lancaster University with a first-class honours degree. I'm currently based in the north of England.

I have lots of experience with Go, Python, and Java, as well as a solid understanding of C, Bash and HTML/CSS, plus experience using various technologies including (obviously) Couchbase, MySQL, Kubernetes, Git, Nginx, and Docker. I have an interest in networking, distributed computing, and backend development.

My github is primarily some personal projects and forks of work repositories, as well as some coursework from my time at University.
